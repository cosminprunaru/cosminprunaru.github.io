              <h3 class="mb-0">Problem</h3>
              <p>Are you aware of your posture? More and more people perform
                their work sitting down. But the human body is not designed to
                sit for prolonged periods. Let alone sitting ‘incorrectly’ for
                long periods.But sadly most people pay far too little attention
                to this. They often fail to realize sufficiently that health and
                a proper seated posture are intimately linked. Awareness is
                frequently gained only after physical problems arise.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Our solution</h3>
              <p>MYCS monitors the user's seated posture and provides feedback
              where necessary. Sensors in the seat and back register and record
              the user's posture. The chair makes the user aware of their posture.
              This feedback contributes to increasing users' awareness of their
              seated posture. Ultimately, this means that users go home fitter.</p>

              <p>With a schedule that forces many people to stay in the same position

                that your position has changed, and very likely not in a good way.

                 on what you are doing and stop worrying about your postion. You

              <p>Our clients are the people who spend a lot of time standing on a chair,
                 at the office, being predisposed to back problems. So we started
                 by asking directly for the opinion of our colleges at work and college,
                 as they are part of our target. We also asked them to help us distribute
                 an online <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmbA4YE8YnYIDhgOMy5zc2eIPxDWjSykadZorNAbjJBkZ-2Q/viewform">form</a>
                 , by sending it to all of their contacts.</p>

              <p>The plan is to target the well known categories that are affected
                 by the problem we are trying to solve and to see if our ideas converge
                 with the potential customers ideas.</p>

              <p>The customer discovery process was split in two halves. In the
                 first one we tried to identify more accurately the target categories.
                 We did this by sending online questionnaires to large groups of people
                 belonging to a wide range of occupations. After gathering all the information
                 from the questionnaires we identified the interest groups.</p>

              <p>86% of the corporate industry(IT, sales, customer support) respondents,
                 complained about neck and back problems caused by their consistently
                unhealthy posture at the office or are aware of the dangers of this issue.</p>

              <p>Other groups, people that don't use to stay at the office for so long,
                 did not have such conclusive opinions about the regarding problem.</p>

              <p>The second phase was going in a more direct conversation with the target
                 group discovered before. After the face-to-face discussions we concluded
                 the followings:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>persons aged 35+ are more prone to back problems that complementary
                    category(55% vs 34%);</li>
                <li>regardless the age, 80% those who spend 8+ hours at the office
                    consider that posture is a factor they should be aware of;</li>
                <li>75% of the interviewed said that an idea like MYCS is something
                    good and would be glad to have an intelligent chair at their workplace;</li>
                <li>only 30% said that would buy one out of their own incentive;</li>
                <li>after asking those with managerial or administration related work positions,
                   we saw openness. "We would strongly consider such an options" most responded.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The most significant aspect that changed after reaching with the
                 customers was the orientation of the bussiness. A bussiness-to-bussiness
                 strategy looks like the best approach due to responses that we got.</p>

              <p>At this time, the competition is mostly made from new-born projects.
                Projects that are in their earliest stage and that even though present
                the same ideea, are different in many aspects.
                Surpassing the competitons will need strategic analysis on the target market,
                on how and when to lauch ad campains, how to manage the development phase and how
                to balance the finances.
                The risk of not surpassing the competition must be considered, and even in a scenario
                when MYCS is not leading the market for the first 3 years, giving the potentially
                small number of players, the market share looks promising enough.

              <p>
                We started presenting our product within the university and various
                companies, especially IT, to which we had access through friends and
                acquaintances. They all are part of our target, being people who
                spend more than 7 hours a day sitting on a chair. In addition, they
                are passionate about technology and anything that could make life easier.
                This approach was a good one because we received a lot of feedback,
                ways by which we can improve our product and also 70% of the participants
                were interested in getting a demo for a set amount of time, while
                another 8% were willing to buy directly. So, we offered each of the
                interested companies with a free demo product for a month so employees
                can test it during break times. We also followed the relevant events
                taking place around us and we tried to expose our product at the ones
                that seemed most promising, alternatively going to bigger events
                as attendees.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also contacted niche blogs, which are addressing lifestyle practices
                and technology trends, and tried to get them review our product.
                To make it easy for them, we offered to walk them through the product,
                showing the functionality and the possible use cases. For some of
                them we had to make the offer more enticing by giving the opportunity
                to give something away to their audience, so we offered a free demo
                product to the first ten potential clients. We’ve been able to convince
                a few local bloggers and we recorded a number of requests from people
                willing to try our product.
              </p>

              <p>We offered our potential customers the opportunity to enroll
